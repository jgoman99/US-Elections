Ideas:
House of representatives closeness. The house has also become close in recent years (<5% margin). Massive incumbency advantage.
About 50-90 new reps per 2 year cycle.
* frequent cycles
* hard to cheat (oligopoly sense)
* evidence of cooperation (e.g. not running candidates)
* is there running unpopular/controversial candidates maybe?
* evidence of putting up barriers (E.g. w/ regard to greens/libertarians/socialists)
* base states disentagled from each other
* money extraction - close races. Close races - close polls. pollster/lobbyists hang out together?
(house of cards uk, second season)
*20-60 seats seem to flip 
natural equilibrium :
party in power may appoint house/senators to cabinet (removing them) when they have a clear majority
funding does seem to swing by year!!!
also: if you adjust party by natural advantage (e.g. due to geography its a bit easier for republicans)
alt explanation may be better than duopoly explanation

to ask: is there large voter realignment in house elections?
get: funding w/ adjustment. plot against seats won

maybe wrong to look at 2016 onwards. breakdown of duopoly?


definitions:
Pivotal votes - votes needed to change election.
optimal votes - votes needed to win election if a new party was created that optimally allocated

To remember: pivotal/optimal votes should usually be halved (e.g. votes dont appear out of nowhere,
they are from people switching/ entering)
