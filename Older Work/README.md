# US-Elections


### Data:
elections_historic_updated_2020 is based on the elections_historic dataset in the rpackage 'socviz'. It has 
been modified to include the year 2020. Other additions may have also been made. Also this has been done for fun,
so don't expect 100% accuracy.

* LBJ is marked as incumbent

presidential_elections_since_1920 was scraped from wikipedia using rvest. (Thank you wikipedia)
